        <p>Here we will go into the methods and inner workings of the project</p>
        <h2>Briefly...</h2>
        <p> The project has 3 major working parts. </p>

        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p> We are conducting a large data collection study to gather handwriting samples
          from a variety of participants across the world (most in the Midwest). Each participant
          provides handwriting samples at three sessions. Session packets are prepared, mailed
          to participants, completed, and mailed back. </p>
        <p>
          Once recieved, we scan all surveys and writing samples. Scans are loaded,
          cropped, and saved using a Shiny app. The app also facilitates survey data entry,
          saving that participant data to lines in an excel spreadsheet. </p>
        <p> A public database of handwriting samples we have collected can be found at
          <a href="https://forensicstats.org/handwritingdatabase/">forensicstats.org/handwritingdatabase</a>.</p>
        <p> A data article regarding these samples was accepted at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919314155?via%3Dihub"> Data in Brief </a><br>
          Crawford, A., Ray, A., & Carriquiry, A. (2020). A database of handwriting samples for applications in forensic statistics. Data in brief, 28, 105059.</p>

        <h2>Computational Tools</h2>
        <p> <code> handwriter </code> is a developmental R package hosted at <a href="https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/handwriter">github.com/CSAFE-ISU/handwriter</a>. It is our major computational tool for the project. The package takes in scanned
          handwritten documents and the following are performed.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Binarize</b> - Turn the image into pure black and white</li>
          <li><b>Skeltonize</b> - Reduce writing to a 1 pixel wide skelton</li>
          <li><b>Break</b> - Connected writing is decomposed into small manageable pieces called <b>glyphs</b>.
            <br><b>Glyphs</b> are graphical structures with nodes and edges that often, but not always, correspond to
            Roman letters, and are the smallest unit of observation we consider for statistcal modelling.</li>
          <li><b>Measure</b> - Measure are taken on each glyph</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Below is an example we commonly use, the word 'csafe' in cursive. In this example you can see the gray background of the writing,
          a result of <b>binarization</b>. The colored lines is the single pixel <b>skelton</b>. The change from green to blue marks
          the changes after the piece of writing is <b>broken</b> into glpyhs. The red dots are the endpoints and intersections
          of each glyph.</p>

        </body>
        <p><br> From this point, measurements are taken on each glyph individually... </p>
        <h4>Rotational Angle</h4>
        <p></p>
        <h5>Compactness</h5>
        <p> While we didn't as much success in any other measurement compared to rotational angle,
          we feel these two are still worth mentioning </p>
        <p>Compactness is computed as:</p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/compactness_equation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="compactness_equation">
        </body>
        <p>It can be thought of as the tightness of black pixels in each glyph based on distance from the centroid</p>
        <p>A number is found, and the measure can be plotted around the centroid as such:</p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/compactness_examples.png" class="img-fluid" alt="compactness_examples">
        </body>
        <p> Unfortunatley, While informative for comparing like-sized graphs, this measurement suffers from the inherit
          spacial dependence between pixels and (unfortunately) does not scale well for modelling.</p>

        <h5>Loop</h5>
        <p>The number of loops are found, as well as the height to width ratio of each</p>
        <p>This information can then be plotted as such: <p>

            <p> Unfortunatley, we found that most loops in handwriting are generally about the same shape, and couldn'<table>
                glean any useful information in differentiating between wrtiers </p>
            </table>
