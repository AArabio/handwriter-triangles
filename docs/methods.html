        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <h5></h5>
        <p>Here we will go into our software methods and inner workings of the package</p>

        <p> <code> handwriter </code> is a developmental R package hosted at <a href="https://github.com/CSAFE-ISU/handwriter">github.com/CSAFE-ISU/handwriter</a>.
          It is our major computational tool for the project. The package takes in scanned
          handwritten documents and the following are performed.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Binarize</b> - Turn the image into pure black and white</li>
          <li><b>Skeltonize</b> - Reduce writing to a 1 pixel wide skelton</li>
          <li><b>Break</b> - Connected writing is decomposed into small manageable pieces called <b>glyphs</b>.
            <br><b>Glyphs</b> are graphical structures with nodes and edges that often, but not always, correspond to
            Roman letters, and are the smallest unit of observation we consider for statistcal modelling.</li>
          <li><b>Measure</b> - Measure are taken on each glyph</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Below is an example we commonly use, the word 'csafe' in cursive. In this example you can see the gray background of the writing,
          a result of <b>binarization</b>. The colored lines is the single pixel <b>skeleton</b>. The change from green to blue marks
          the changes after the piece of writing is <b>broken</b> into glpyhs. The red dots are the endpoints and intersections
          of each glyph.</p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/csafe_all_features.png" class="img-fluid" alt="csafe_all_features">
        </body>
        <p><br> From this point, measurements are taken on each glyph individually. These measurements are calculated in
          <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html">Rcpp</a>,
          a power package that allows for R functions to be implemented in C++. The measurements we looked at are <b>Rotational Angle, Compactness, and Loops</b>.
          Rotation Angle is by far the most useful measurement, but we feel all are worth mentioning. </p>
        <h4>Rotational Angle</h4>
        <p> The first principal component for each glyph, or “letter”, is calculated through an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix.
          The first principal component enjoys the property of having two invariant directions, and so we take the vector that lies in the
          upper half plane. The rotation angle of the graph is defined as the angle between the vector (0,1), and the unit principal component
          vector on the upper half plane. The angle is measured in radians and is considered a feature of the graph defined on the interval (0,π). </p>

        <p><b>Let's walk through an example of how rotational angle can help differentiate between two writers.</b></p>
        <p> Here is the scanned writing of "Our London business is good," from our first writer, writer A: </p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/London_writing_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="London_writing_1">
        </body>
        <p>These measurements are used to differntiate inside of each cluster, so we will look at the cluster of glyphs most similar to the letter 'u' in the roman alphabet.</p>
        On the left is the cluster for this glyph. On the right is 4 individual glyphs from the writing, as well as a graph with each glyphs direction of greatest variability </p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/London_u_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="London_u_1">
        </body>
        <p> Now, the directions determined above are compiled for each cluster from each writer. The compiled graph for the glyph closed to the letter u from our writer A is shown on the left below.
          This data is then normalized to respect the polar coordinate system, and a curve is fit to approximate the distribuition of the rotation angle, show on the right </p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/London_Graph_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="London_Graph_1">
        </body>
        <br>
        <p> The same can be done for a writer B: </p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/London_writing_2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="London_writing_2">
        </body>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/London_u_2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="London_u_2">
        </body>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/London_Graph_2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="London_Graph_2">
        </body>

        <p> There is great dispartiy in the distribuition of the rotation angle between writer A and B when dealing with this cluster. We have found this measurement to be the most influential
          in correctly identifying a writer.</p>
        <h5>Compactness</h5>
        <p>Compactness is computed as:</p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/compactness_equation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="compactness_equation">
        </body>
        <p>It can be thought of as the tightness of black pixels in each glyph based on distance from the centroid</p>
        <p>A compactness value is found, and can be plotted around the centroid as such:</p>

        <body>
          <img src="Pictures/compactness_examples.png" class="img-fluid" alt="compactness_examples">
        </body>
        <p> Unfortunatley, while informative for comparing like-sized graphs, this measurement suffers from the inherit
          spacial dependence between pixels and (unfortunately) does not scale well for modelling.</p>

        <h5>Loops</h5>
        <p>The number of loops in a given glyph are found, as well as the height to width ratio of each.</p>

        <p> Unfortunatley, we found that most loops in handwriting are generally about the same shape, and
          didn't produce any useful information in differentiating between writers. </p>

        <h4>What's next?</h4>
        <p> once each glyphs measrurements have been taken and saved, <code>handwriter's</code> job is done. You can now take this information and integrate it into your specific workflow. </p>
